#Documentation

This is a description of the files in this project.

### HTML5 Boilerplate
The license and readme .md files are left in the project because this site is based off of [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate). To better understand this site feel free to read [their documentation](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/v4/doc/TOC.md).

### index.html
This is the main page of the site. It describes who we are and what we do.

### 404.html
This page is where 404 "Not Found" errors lead, for example when somebody attempts to go to www.mhsbyte.org/asdfghjkl

### favicon.ico
This is the picture that shows up next to our name on a tab.

### apple-touch-icon
apple-touch-icon.ico and apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png are files that are around waiting for someone to add mhsbyte.org to their iPhone or iPod's home screen. (It actually looks pretty nice.)

### browserconfig and tiles
browserconfig.xml, tile.png and tile-wide.png are files that are around waiting for someone to pins mhsbyte.org to their Windows 8 screen. (It probably looks pretty nice.)

### README.md
That's this file. It shows up at the bottom of the project ("repository") page and is obviously there so people can read it and find out more about the repo.

### .gitignore
.gitignore is a file that lets us specify files to ignore when uploading to github. For example, if you made an image to add to the site, you might have its .pdf and its .jpg in the /img folder. .gitignore would allow you to just upload the .jpg.

### .gitattributes
.gitattributes allows lots of specific project properties. For example, if you've ever noticed that opening text files sometimes open one very long line of text? That's because new lines differ between operating systems. The .gitattributes text = auto setting makes sure that new lines work and also that puttings different types of new lines isn't counted as a code change.

### .editorconfig
.editorconfig specifies the formatting of documents in this repo to your text editor if it supports .editorconfig files. This formatting can include things like indent sizes and whether to remove whitespace at the  end of a document.

### /css
The css folder contains the stylesheets used on our site
main.css is the main stylesheet used in HTML5 Boilerplate.
normalize.css was also included in HTML5 Boilerplate and is supposed to help browser compatibility.
style.css is the custom css our site uses.

### /img
The img folder contains the images used on our site
.gitignore is desribed aboce
The rest of the files here are just images on the site.

### /js
The js folder contains the javascript scripts used on our site
jquery is in /js/vendor and is a prevalent javascript library used today. It makes coding scripts less painful.
modernizr is also in /js/vendor and is supposed to help browser compatibility.

### CNAME
The CNAME file specifies what domain name the code is for.
